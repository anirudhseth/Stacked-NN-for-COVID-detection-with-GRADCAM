# DeepLearningOnCOVID19

In this project, we investigate and develop a multi class deep convolutional
network to assist in the classification of chest X-ray images. To account for the lack
of publicly available COVID19 data we explore and perform comparative analysis
of various data augmentation techniques and their applicability on X-ray images.
Finally we apply Grad-CAM to highlight the regions of high importance and
improve the explainability of our deep neural network.
